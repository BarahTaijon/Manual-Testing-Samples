# Login Feature – Manual Test Cases

This folder contains manual test cases created for the **Login feature** of a web application.
The test cases are designed as part of a training and learning exercise to demonstrate
manual testing skills and test case design techniques.

---

## 📌 Scope
The scope of testing for the Login feature includes:
- Login page UI validation
- Responsive design across different devices
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility
- Valid and invalid login scenarios
- Boundary value and negative testing
- Session-related behaviors (e.g. Remember Me, browser back, session persistence)
- Basic security-related scenarios from a UI perspective

---

## ⚠️ Assumptions
- The application has a working Login page.
- Username and Password fields are mandatory.
- Valid and invalid credentials are predefined for testing purposes.
- Error messages are displayed according to system requirements.
- Session persistence and account lockout behaviors are enabled **as per configuration**.
- Test data used is **dummy data** created for training purposes only.

- Login with valid credentials
- Login with invalid, blank, and inactive credentials
- Username and password boundary limits
- Keyboard navigation using Tab and Enter keys
- Responsive behavior on different screen sizes
- Login behavior across multiple browsers
- Remember Me functionality
- Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
- Navigation behavior (Back button, browser close)
- Localization (language change)

---

## ❌ What is Not Covered
- Backend or database validation
- Password encryption or hashing verification
- Performance or load testing
- Penetration or advanced security testing
- Third-party authentication (e.g. Google, Facebook login)

---

## 🛠 Tools & Approach
- Manual testing
- Test cases documented using Excel/Spreadsheet format

---

## 📝 Notes
- This is a **training project**.
- Test cases are written to demonstrate testing knowledge, not to validate a real production system.
